A more minmode-y minmode HUD for TF2.

The goal of this HUD is to try to stick to the stock Team Fortress 2 styled display, while stripping things down a bit more.  It also intends to be modular, allowing you to add and remove any specific component easily.  Like the disguise menu but would rather have the default loadout screen (or did Valve's new update make the client crash if it was used again)?  Just remove the VPK.

As such, and probably ironically, the modularized format of this HUD also might it incompatible with most other custom HUDs, as it does not touch `hudlayout.res` at all.

And funnily enough, this HUD does not have a `cl_minmode`-enabled option, which may have been left untouched.  If you've any suggestions, feel free to fork and push any changes.

Screenshots coming soon.
